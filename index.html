        <h2>LLMs</h2>
        <p>
          Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on massive text datasets to
          understand and generate human-like language. They are widely used for writing,
          coding assistance, summarization, translation, and conversational interfaces.

        <h2>Agentic AI</h2>
        <p>
          Agentic AI describes AI that can act toward goals by planning steps, making
          decisions, and using tools with limited supervision. Instead of only responding
          once, it can operate through multi-step workflows.

        <h2>Multi Agentic AI</h2>
        <p>
          Multi Agentic AI involves multiple AI agents working together, often with
          different roles, to solve larger tasks. This approach improves scalability,
          specialization, and problem-solving through coordination.

        <h2>Artificial Generative Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Generative Intelligence focuses on creating new content such as text,
          images, audio, video, and code. Its core value is generation and synthesis, not
          just analysis or prediction.

        <h2>Super Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Super Intelligence is a theoretical AI level that surpasses human intelligence
          across nearly all domains, including reasoning, creativity, strategy, and
          scientific discovery. It remains a future concept rather than current reality.
